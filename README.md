Quick implementation of the following TSP heuristic solutions for a course project -
 - Nearest Neighbours
 - Nearest Insertion

The heuristic approaches used are described in detail [here](http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~mac/ensino/docs/OR/CombinatorialOptimizationHeuristicsLocalSearch.pdf).

### Steps
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Execute `python run.py` to solve and plot the solution for the TSP problem defined by the locations of the nodes in `data/locations.txt`.
